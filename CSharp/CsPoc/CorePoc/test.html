    Looks how cool is <font size="x-large"><b>Open Xml</b></font>.
    Now with <font color="red"><u>HtmlToOpenXml</u></font>, it nevers been so easy to convert html.

                        The load of this bolt connection is mainly transverse load due to
                        short-circuit torque. Let’s assume that all bolts were preloaded by the minimum assembly
                        preload(which was very conservative), then the short-circuit happened, the joint were to slip,
                        the maximum shearing stress on a bolt in the cross section is calculated as
                        below:
